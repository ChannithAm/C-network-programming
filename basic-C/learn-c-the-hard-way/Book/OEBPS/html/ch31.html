<h2 id="ch31"><a id="page_172"/>Exercise 31. Common Undefined Behavior</h2>
<p class="noindent">At this point in the book, it&#8217;s time to introduce you to the most common kinds of UB that you will encounter. C has 191 behaviors that the standards committee has decided aren&#8217;t defined by the standard, and therefore anything goes. Some of these behaviors are legitimately not the compiler&#8217;s job, but the vast majority are simply lazy capitulations by the standards committee that cause annoyances, or worse, defects. An example of laziness:</p>
<p class="uln-indent"><em>An unmatched &#8220;or&#8221; character is encountered on a logical source line during tokenization.</em></p>
<p class="noindent">In this instance, the C99 standard actually allows a compiler writer to fail at a parsing task that a junior in college could get right. Why is this? Who knows, but most likely someone on the standards committee was working on a C compiler with this defect and managed to get this in the standard rather than fix their compiler. Or, as I said, simple laziness.</p>
<p class="noindent">The crux of the issue with UB is the difference between the C abstract machine, defined in the standard and real computers. The C standard describes the C language according to a strictly defined abstract machine. This is a perfectly valid way to design a language, except where the C standard goes wrong: It doesn&#8217;t require compilers to implement this abstract machine and enforce its specification. Instead, a compiler writer can completely ignore the abstract machine in 191 instances of the standard. It should really be called an &#8220;abstract machine, but&#8221;, as in, &#8220;It&#8217;s a strictly defined abstract machine, but...&#8221;</p>
<p class="noindent">This allows the standards committee and compiler implementers to have their cake and eat it, too. They can have a standard that is full of omissions, lax specification, and errors, but when <em>you</em> encounter one of these, they can point at the abstract machine and simply say in their best robot voice, &#8220;THE ABSTRACT MACHINE IS ALL THAT MATTERS. YOU DO NOT CONFORM!&#8221; Yet, in 191 instances that compiler writers don&#8217;t have to conform, you do. You are a second class citizen, even though the language is really written for you to use.</p>
<p class="noindent">This means that <em>you</em>, not the compiler writer, are left to enforce the rules of an abstract computational machine, and when you inevitably fail, it&#8217;s your fault. The compiler doesn&#8217;t have to flag the UB, do anything reasonable, and it&#8217;s your fault for not memorizing all 191 rules that should be avoided. You are just stupid for not memorizing 191 complex potholes on the road to C. This is a wonderful situation for the classic know-it-all type who can memorize these 191 finer points of annoyance with which to beat beginners to intellectual death.</p>
<p class="noindent">There&#8217;s an additional hypocrisy with UB that is doubly infuriating. If you show a C fanatic code that properly uses C strings but can overwrite the string terminator, they will say, &#8220;That&#8217;s UB. It&#8217;s not the C language&#8217;s fault!&#8221; However, if you show them UB that has <code>while(x) x &lt;&lt;= 1</code> in it, they will say, &#8220;That&#8217;s UB idiot! Fix your damn code!&#8221; This lets the C fanatic simultaneously use UB to defend <a id="page_173"/>the purity of C&#8217;s design, and also beat you up for being an idiot who writes bad code. Some UB is meant as, &#8220;you can ignore the security of this since it&#8217;s not C&#8217;s fault&#8221;, and other UB is meant as, &#8220;you are an idiot for writing this code,&#8221; and the distinction between the two is not specified in the standard.</p>
<p class="noindent">As you can see, I am <em>not</em> a fan of the huge list of UB. I had to memorize all of these before the C99 standard, and just didn&#8217;t bother to memorize the changes. I&#8217;d simply moved on to a way and found a way to avoid as much UB as I possibly could, trying to stay within the abstract machine specification while also working with real machines. This turns out to be almost impossible, so I just don&#8217;t write new code in C anymore because of its glaringly obvious problems.</p>
<div class="note"><hr/>
<p class="title">Warning!</p>
<p class="sb-noindent">The technical explanation as to why C UB is wrong comes from Alan Turing:</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>1.</strong> C UB contains behaviors that are lexical, semantic, and execution based.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>2.</strong> The lexical and semantic behaviors can be detected by the compiler.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>3.</strong> The execution-based behaviors fall into Turing&#8217;s definition of the <em>halting problem</em>, and are therefore NP-complete.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>4.</strong> This means that to avoid C UB, it requires solving one of the oldest proven unsolvable problems in computer science, making UB effectively impossible for a computer to avoid.</p>
<p class="noindent">To put it more succinctly: &#8220;If the only way to know that you&#8217;ve violated the abstract machine with UB is to run your C program, then you will never be able to completely avoid UB.&#8221;</p>

<h3 id="ch31lev1sec1">UB 20</h3>
<p class="noindent">Because of this, I&#8217;m going to list the top 20 undefined behaviors in C, and tell you how to avoid them as best I can. In general, the way to avoid UB is to write clean code, but some of these behaviors are impossible to avoid. For example, writing past the end of a C string is an undefined behavior, yet it&#8217;s easily done by accident and externally accessible to an attacker. This list will also include related UB that all fall into the same category but with differing contexts.</p>

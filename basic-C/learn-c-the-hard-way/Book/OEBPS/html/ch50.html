<p class="noindent">Once you&#8217;ve solved the problem of the protocol and putting statistics into a data structure, you&#8217;ll want to make this much richer. This exercise may require that you redesign and refactor some of your code. That&#8217;s on purpose, as this is an absolute requirement when writing software. You must frequently throw out old code to make room for new code. Never get too attached to something you&#8217;ve written.</p>
<p class="noindent">In this exercise, you&#8217;re going to use the URL routing from <a href="ch47.html#ch47">Exercise 47</a> to augment your protocol, allowing statistics to be stored at arbitrary URL paths.</p>
<p class="noindent">This is all the help you get. It&#8217;s a simple requirement that you have to attempt on your own, modifying your protocol, updating your data structures, and changing your code to make it work.</p>
<p class="noindent">Watch the lecture video to see what I want, and then try your best before watching the second video to see how I implemented it.<a id="page_343"/></p>

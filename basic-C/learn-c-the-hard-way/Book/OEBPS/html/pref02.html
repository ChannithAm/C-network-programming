<p class="noindent">I would like to thank three kinds of people who helped make this book what it is today: the haters, the helpers, and the painters.</p>
<p class="noindent">The haters helped make this book stronger and more solid through their inflexibility of mind, irrational hero worship of old C gods, and complete lack of pedagogical expertise. Without their shining example of what not to be, I would have never worked so hard to make this book a complete introduction to becoming a better programmer.</p>
<p class="noindent">The helpers are Debra Williams Cauley, Vicki Rowland, Elizabeth Ryan, the whole team at Addison-Wesley, and everyone online who sent in fixes and suggestions. Their work producing, fixing, editing, and improving this book has formed it into a more professional and better piece of writing.</p>
<p class="noindent">The painters, <code>Brian</code>, <code>Arthur</code>, <code>Vesta</code>, and <code>Sarah</code>, helped me find a new way to express myself and to distract me from deadlines that Deb and Vicki clearly set for me but that I kept missing. Without painting and the gift of art these artists gave me, I would have a less meaningful and rich life.</p>
<p class="noindent">Thank you to all of you for helping me write this book. It may not be perfect, because no book is perfect, but it&#8217;s at least as good as I can possibly make it.<a id="page_1"/></p>

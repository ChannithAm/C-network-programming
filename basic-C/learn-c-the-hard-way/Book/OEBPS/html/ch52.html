<p class="noindent">The final exercise consists of three videos. The first video is a lecture on how to hack your server and attempt to destroy it. In the video, I show you a great many tools and tricks for breaking protocols, using my <em>own</em> implementation to demonstrate flaws in the design. This video is fun, and if you&#8217;ve been following along with your own code, you can compete with me to see who made the more robust server.</p>
<p class="noindent">The second video then demonstrates how I&#8217;d add improvements to the server. You should attempt your own improvements first, before watching this video, and then see if your improvements are similar to mine.</p>
<p class="noindent">The third and final video teaches you how to make further improvements and design decisions in the project. It covers everything I&#8217;d think about to complete the project and refine it. Typically, to complete a project, I&#8217;d do the following:</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>1.</strong> Get it online and accessible to people.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>2.</strong> Document it and improve the usability to make sure that the documents are easy to read.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>3.</strong> Do as much test coverage as possible.</p>
<p class="indenthangingN"><strong>4.</strong> Improve any corner cases and add defenses against any attacks that I can find.</p>
<p class="noindent">The second video demonstrates each of these and explains how you can do them yourself.<a id="page_347"/></p>
